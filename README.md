# TeamRocket

TeamRocket is the name of our Senior Design Group. Our aim is to develop a pre-phase A rocket design tool.

## Installation

Download the repository to your local machine and install the following packages using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install PySimpleGUI

# These should come with the python environment, but just in case you can run the following to make sure:
pip install csv
pip install math
```

## Usage

Usage of the software is fairly simple. Simply run the executable and enter parameters for the small launch vehicle into the corresponding fields. After all the parameter fields are filled out, click the 'Submit' button and the results will be displayed. Options are given to the user to load in parameters from different rockets including our Senior Design project and the Japanese SS-520 rocket.
