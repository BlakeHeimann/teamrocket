# TeamRocket

TeamRocket is the name of our Senior Design Group. Our aim is to develop a pre-phase A rocket design tool.

## Installation

Download the repository to your local machine and install the following packages using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install numpy
pip install PySimpleGUI

# These should come with the python environment, but just in case you can run the following to make sure:
pip install csv
pip install math
```

## Usage

Usage of the software is fairly simple. Simply run the gui.py script and enter parameters for the small launch vehicle into the corresponding fields. After all the parameter fields are filled out, click the 'Submit'. Options are given to the user to load in parameters from different rockets including our Senior Design project and the Japanese SS-520 rocket.

After Clicking the 'Submit' button, click the 'Show Results' button to see the important outputs from the engineering models.
