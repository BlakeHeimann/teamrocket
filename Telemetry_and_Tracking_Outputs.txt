Telemetry and Tracking Outputs
- Telemetry
   - 26.67 kilobits required for transmitting sensor data
   - This provides for transmitting up to 1 Megabyte of data every 5 minutes
   - Equation used for data transfer rate listed here
   - 

- Tracking
   - Tracking must provide coverage from the Mid-Atlantic 
     Regional Spaceport [37.84341N, -75.478195E] to [37.84341N, -67.6076E].
   - Remains within the vertical bounds for tracking throughout flight.
   - Upon reaching 180 km of eastward travel, the tracking responsibilities 
     will be picked up by the TDRSS and continued through the payloadâ€™s release.
   - Tracking coverage estimated at 85% 
   - Remaining 15% accounts for loss of coverage from Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport
